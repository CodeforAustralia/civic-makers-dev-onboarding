### Need Help?

- If youâ€™re not sure what to work on, or what to do, or youâ€™re stuck with on of the onboarding tasks, please ask on [#civic-makers-climatechange-dev](https://codeforaustralia.slack.com/archives/C01DALXS62K) . One of the volunteers from the dev team will get back to you as soon as we can (please be patient)
- If for some reason you're having issues getting on to the slack channel, please notify the dev leads in a comment in this onboarding github issue that you've created. Notify the dev leads using their github handles **@batteries76** (Matt McKenzie) and **@hqtan** (Qing). See [this comment in this onboarding issue](https://github.com/CodeforAustralia/civic-makers-dev-onboarding/issues/1#issuecomment-1035553988) for example.
- If you have an idea that youâ€™d like to work on, but isnâ€™t mentioned in our Trello board, please reach out to our Product Lead or the leads team to have a chat. You can find out more about the lead team in [this doc](https://www.notion.so/Meet-the-current-lead-team-47516a1ebb43496fbdee55f258ec1828), and contact them via slack.
    - **N.B:** We love new ideas! But *even more*, we love new ideas that are aligned with the features we want to build, and our current projectâ€™s mission/objectives ðŸ™‚. See [this doc](https://www.notion.so/Current-project-info-1f6f7e7f36e14a0b8d7d0923de75d14d) to get acquainted with that.
